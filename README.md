C++ mathematic expression parser

About
=====

MathParser is a personal project leaded by Richard Degenne. It aims to create a standalone mathematic expression parser, based on its own mathematic entities and operations. Note that I will try to maintain an updated documentation, both in the code and in the MathParser GitHub wiki.

Since it is a personal project, it is more of an recreational exercise than a real fully-developed project. However, if you want to help out or take a look to the way it is coded, feel free to fork and work around with it.
